Bases describe the state at which the current position is measured. In terms of Cartesian System it is often describe in the format of P(x,y,z). 

**Note:**
Generic representation considers z-axis to move upwards, x-axis to move towards (or away) us and y-axis to move side ways. 

### Bases with respect to Quantum Gates 
Quantum Gates rotate the Qubit represented in the Bloch sphere to rotate. 
#### X Gate:
Pauli's X gate rotates the Qubit by **108**$^0$.

**H Gate:**
Hardamard's Gate brings a initialised Qubit to state of superposition.  This gate play a key role in Quantum Computing as it brings the Qubit from Z-bases (0 and 1) to X-bases (+ and -).

#### Z Gate:
Pauli's Z gate is used to rotate a Qubit in X-Bases by **180**$^0$. 

**Note:**
In physical sense, the state change is shown by applying specific polarised light to the Qubit. This changes the bases or the state of Qubit. 

#### P-Gates, S-Gates and H-Gates:

### Quantum Circuits:
1. Create using combination of Quantum Gates. 
2. Default initialisation is 0.
