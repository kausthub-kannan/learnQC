- When creating a new webpage, add it to appropriate folder (ex: all algorithms should be added to _algorithms folder)
- For every new webpage add the below at the begining of the page:

```
---

permalink: /path_on_the_bar/ **Note:** Use % to add spaces
---
```

- If a new subsection needs to be created, create a folder with the name of subsection with '_' in the start of the name and add the folder with title in _config.yml
